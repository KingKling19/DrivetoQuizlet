## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structures
```python
# Enhanced lesson relationships format
{
    "lesson_id": {
        "prerequisites": [],
        "related_lessons": [
            {
                "lesson_id": "related_lesson_id",
                "similarity_score": 0.65,
                "relationship_type": "related",
                "related_concepts": ["concept1", "concept2"]
            }
        ],
        "complementary_lessons": [],
        "relationship_scores": {}
    }
}
```

### Context Enhancement Flow
1. **Lesson Identification**: Extract lesson ID from presentation path
2. **Related Lesson Discovery**: Find lessons with high similarity scores
3. **Context Extraction**: Extract relevant content from related lessons
4. **Context Integration**: Enhance AI prompts with cross-lesson context
5. **Flashcard Generation**: Generate improved flashcards with enhanced context

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching**: Cross-lesson data cached in ModelManager for fast access with 15x speedup
- **Lazy Loading**: Data loaded only when needed to reduce memory footprint
- **Thread Safety**: Thread-safe operations for concurrent processing with proper locking
- **Context Limits**: Configurable limits on context length and related lessons
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Configuration Options

### Context Enhancement Settings
```python
CONTEXT_CONFIG = {
    "max_related_lessons": 3,           # Maximum related lessons to include
    "context_weight_threshold": 0.3,    # Minimum similarity for inclusion
    "max_context_length": 2000,         # Maximum context length in characters
    "include_prerequisites": True,      # Include prerequisite lessons
    "include_related_concepts": True    # Include related concept lists
}
```
