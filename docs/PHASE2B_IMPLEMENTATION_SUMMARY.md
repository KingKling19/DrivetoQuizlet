## Technical Implementation Details

### Context Weighting Factors

1. **Semantic Similarity (40%)**
   - Uses OpenAI embeddings for semantic comparison
   - Cosine similarity calculation between lesson embeddings
   - High accuracy for conceptual relationships

2. **Concept Overlap (30%)**
   - Jaccard similarity between key concepts
   - Identifies shared terminology and definitions
   - Important for avoiding duplicate content

3. **Lesson Relationship Strength (20%)**
   - Leverages pre-computed lesson relationships
   - Boosts scores for prerequisite and complementary relationships
   - Considers curriculum structure

4. **Content Freshness (10%)**
   - Based on processing timestamps
   - Favors recently updated content
   - Ensures current information priority

### Adaptive Context Selection

The system implements intelligent context selection that:
- Dynamically adjusts context window size based on content complexity
- Prioritizes high-quality, relevant content
- Balances context depth with processing efficiency
- Provides quality assessment and recommendations

### Quality Assessment Metrics

- **Quality Score**: Overall context relevance (0-1 scale)
- **Coverage Score**: Amount of context coverage
- **Diversity Score**: Variety of relationship types
- **Recommendations**: Specific improvement suggestions
