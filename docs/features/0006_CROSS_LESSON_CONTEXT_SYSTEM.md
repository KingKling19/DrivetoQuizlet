# Feature 6: Cross-Lesson Context System - Technical Plan

## Feature Description
Implement a system to use neighboring lesson content for better context during AI analysis and flashcard generation. This will enhance the quality of content analysis by providing cross-lesson references, related concepts, and contextual information from other lessons in the curriculum.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components

- `scripts/convert_folder_to_quizlet.py` - Main flashcard generation with basic slide windowing
- `scripts/model_manager.py` - AI model management and caching
- `lessons/` directory structure with organized content (TLP, Conducting_Operations_in_a_Degraded_Space, Perform_Effectively_In_An_Operational_Environment)
- **✅ COMPLETED**: `scripts/lesson_content_indexer.py` - Content extraction and indexing system
- **✅ COMPLETED**: `scripts/cross_lesson_analyzer.py` - Cross-lesson relationship analysis
