assessment = assessor.assess_flashcard_quality(flashcard)
print(f"Quality Score: {assessment['overall_score']}")
print(f"Quality Level: {assessment['quality_level']}")

# Batch assessment
flashcards = [...]  # List of flashcards
batch_result = assessor.batch_assess_quality(flashcards)
print(f"Average Score: {batch_result['average_score']}")
